## 1. Introduction 🌟
Welcome to the documentation for Hasya Katta Official Nucleus (HKO-Nucleus), version HKO-N-0.0.2-21.10.2023.11.54. HKO-Nucleus is an operating system nucleus designed for educational purposes, providing a foundation for understanding the inner workings of operating systems. This documentation will guide you through the setup, usage, and development of HKO-Nucleus. 🎓

## 2. Nucleus Overview 💡
HKO-Nucleus is a simple, minimalistic nucleus that demonstrates core concepts of operating system development, such as process management, system calls, and basic I/O. It is not intended for production use but serves as a learning tool for nucleus development. 🧠

## 3. System Requirements 🛠️
HKO-Nucleus can be developed and run on x86-based architectures. To build and run the nucleus, you'll need:
- An x86, x86_64, ARM, or RISC-V based computer or emulator (e.g., QEMU)
- A compatible development environment
- GCC (GNU Compiler Collection)
- Make utility

## 4. Supported Architectures 💻
HKO-Nucleus supports the following architectures:
- x86 (32-bit)
- x86_64 (64-bit)
- ARM (32-bit)
- RISC-V (32-bit)

## 5. Installation ⚙️
HKO-Nucleus is a project you compile and run on your local system for educational purposes. There is no installation required.

## 6. File Structure 📂
The project follows a directory structure to organize the nucleus source code and related files:

- `Hasya Katta Official Nucleus`
  - `Arcx` (Architecture-specific code, e.g., x86, x86_64, ARM, RISC-V)
    - `Arm` (ARM architecture-specific code)
    - `x86` (x86 architecture-specific code)
    - `x86_64` (x86_64 architecture-specific code)
    - `Riscv` (RISC-V architecture-specific code)
    - `RPi` (Raspberry Pi-specific code)
  - `Boot` (Bootloader code, e.g., GRUB, UEFI)
  - `Drvrs` (Hardware device drivers)
